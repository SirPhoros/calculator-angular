# CalculatorAngular

This repository contains my calculator project, developed using `TypeScript`, `Angular`, and `Bootstrap`. The calculator provides basic functionality, allowing users to perform arithmetic calculations and view their operation history.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic calculations
- Operation history display

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SirPhoros/calculator-angular
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run in local:

```bash
npm run start
```

> You need to have installed Angular for this, for more information visit their [page](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

## Usage

1. Open the calculator application in your web browser.
2. Enter numbers and perform calculations using the provided operators.
3. View the history of your recent operations.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to implement the following features:

- Incorporating additional operators, such as `%` and `±`
- Implementing parentheses for complex calculations
- Introducing a Scientific Mode for advanced mathematical operations
- Enhancing the user experience with a numeric keyboard input
- Switch between light and dark mode for optimal accessibility.
